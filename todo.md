add private to robots, rss, sitemap


site.Params.privateSite:
- robots.txt (no follow) .. see below
- no sitemap .. check if there are any pages for the sitemap? if below is set this would be none?


so seo.private in site or page will disable follow meta, robots, rss and sitemap?
page - only page is excluded
site - feature turned off (robots, rss, sitemap)

could be overriden on a page level.. for edge cases

check hugo's twitter and og partials, add multiple images to each
